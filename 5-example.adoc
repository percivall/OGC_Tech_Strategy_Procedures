== Example Clause

[NOTE]
.Instructions
===============================================
This section explains some concepts frequently required by Asciidoc novices. Please use this file as a template for your own clauses.
===============================================

=== Headlines
All headlines are marked by "=" signs. The top level in each each file starts with level 2 ("=="). Important: For whatever strange reason, headings in annexes are marked differently.

=== Figures
If you want to reference a figure by using a figure number, it is important to use the following syntax. The figure identifier for <<img_mindMap>> is the first statement of the header. Please adapt the width as appropriate.

[#img_mindMap,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.High-Level Mind Map of Testbed-14
image::images/t14MindMap.png[width=800,align="center"]

It is important that you use the same syntax for all images, otherwise the automatic numbering is corrupted!

=== Tables
Tables are easy to deal with as long as you keep them simple! To add a table, please use the following syntax.

[#table_countries,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Countries in Europe
[cols="50e,^25m,>25s",width="75%",options="header",align="center"]
|===
|Country | Population | Size

| Monaco
| 36371
| 1.98

| Gibraltar
| 29431
| 6.8
|===

The first line is used for referencing. You can reference <<table_countries>> in your text. The only thing you should change in that line is the table id, which is "table_countries" in this case. Please do not remove the "#", please do not change anything else in that line.

You can define the style and width of each column. In our example, the first column takes 50% of the entire width, the second and third column take 25% each. The total width of the table is 75% of the text width.

The letters after the width percentage indicate if the column is e=emphasis, m=monospaced, a=asciidoc, s=strong. The d=default does not need to be set.

Cell alignment: If you need to align a column, you may indicate this by setting ^,<, or >. Examples:

* ^25m = centered, 25% width, monospaced.
* >25e = aligned right, 25% width, emphasised
* <25 = aligned left, 25% width, asciidoc

In any case, please make sure that your table fit on a piece of A4 or letter-size paper!!

=== Recommended Asciidoc Environment
We recommend to use http://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor] and http://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-asciidoc-to-pdf/[asciidoctor-pdf] in combination with the https://atom.io[Atom] editor.

In Atom, you should install the following packages:

* asciidoc-preview
* autocomplete-asciidoc
* language-asciidoc
* markdown-writer: requires changing of key-map to allow for keyboard shortcuts such as e.g. *bold*
* platformio-IDE-terminal

This environment allows you to use keyboard shortcuts, autocomplete, syntax highlighting and a rendered preview for asciidoc; and provides you an terminal window within the editor to convert your asciidoc to html and pdf.

=== Asciidoc Conversion
In order to achieve a uniform look-and-feel of all ERs in both HTML and PDF, we have provided a css and theme file. The following commands can be used to convert the ER:

*Command for PDF output:*
 asciidoctor-pdf -a pdf-stylesdir=resources -a pdf-style=ogc -a pdf-fontsdir=resources/fonts -o 18-xxx.pdf  er.adoc

*Command for HTML output:*
 asciidoctor -a data-uri -a stylesheet=ogc.css -a stylesdir=./resources/stylesheets -o 18-xxx er.adoc

=== Source Code

You can add code snippets using the following syntax:

.Code Example XML
[source,xml]
----
<section>
  <title>Section Title</title> <!--1-->
</section>
----
<1> This notation allows to reference particular sections within the code.


.Code Example JSON
[source,json]
----
{"menu": {
  "id": "file",
  "value": "File",
  "popup": {
    "menuitem": [
      {"value": "New", "onclick": "CreateNewDoc()"},
      {"value": "Open", "onclick": "OpenDoc()"},
      {"value": "Close", "onclick": "CloseDoc()"}
    ]
  }
}}
----

Is available e.g. here: http://asciidoctor.org/docs/

=== Citations
Please use the following syntax to insert citations:

cite:[VanZyl2009]

Then you need to provide all citation information in the file resources/bibtex-file.bib. Everything else is done automatically.
